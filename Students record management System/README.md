Student Record Management System (C++)

A console-based Student Record Management System developed in C++, designed to efficiently manage student information using fundamental programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project is suitable for academic use, learning purposes, and beginner-level portfolio projects.

📌 Project Description

The Student Record Management System provides a simple and structured way to store and manage student data.
Users can perform essential operations such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting student records.
All records are stored persistently using file handling, ensuring data is not lost after program termination.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of C++ basics, modular programming, and data management techniques in a real-world scenario.
